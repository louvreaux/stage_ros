# stage_ros

This is a _stage\_ros_ package (https://github.com/ros-simulation/stage_ros) modified so that it is able to programatically set pose (kudos to @kleinma and @Victor_ocv2 https://answers.ros.org/question/61503/stageros-how-to-programmatically-set-the-pose-of-a-simulated-robot/)
and pause simulation with a new _/pause\_sim_ service.
